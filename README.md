Sales Prediction with Python on Advertising Dataset 

I tackled the exciting challenge of sales prediction using the Oasis Infobyte advertising dataset. In today's competitive market, accurate sales forecasts play a crucial role in business planning and strategy.

For Task 5, I delved into the world of advertising data, exploring various regression models and data analysis techniques to predict sales based on advertising expenses. Armed with Python and powerful data science libraries, I set out to build a reliable predictive model.

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust model that can leverage past advertising expenditure data to forecast future sales accurately. This valuable insight can empower businesses to optimize their marketing budgets and make data-driven decisions.

Throughout this journey, I encountered intriguing challenges, such as feature selection, model evaluation, and dealing with potential outliers. Each hurdle provided valuable learning opportunities and allowed me to enhance my skills in predictive modeling.
